    <section id="page0" class="section-two">
        <p style="text-align: center;">The air you breathe is not as clean as you may think. Air pollution is a big problem in the world today. Unwanted chemicals, gases, and particles enter the air and atmosphere, causing harm to the planet and all life on it. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), billions of people around the world breathe poor-quality air as a result of pollution.
             Here’s all you need to know about one of the biggest enemies of our planet.</p>
        <h2>What Causes Air Pollution?</h2>
        <img src="pollution1.jpg" style="float:right; border-radius: 20%; margin: 5px; padding-left: 3%; padding-bottom: 2%;" alt="">
        <p>Air pollution is caused by solid and liquid particles and certain gases that are suspended in the air. 
            These particles and gases can come from car and truck exhaust, factories, dust, pollen, mold spores, volcanoes and wildfires.
            The solid and liquid particles suspended in our air are called aerosols, Air pollution happens when solid and liquid particles—called aerosols—and certain gases end up in our air. These particles and gases can be bad for the planet and for our health,
            so keeping track of them is important<br>
            <strong>Where do aerosols come from?</strong><br>
            Any particle that gets picked up into the air or is formed from chemical reactions in the air can be an aerosol. 
            Many aerosols enter the atmosphere when we burn fossil fuels—such as coal and petroleum—and wood. These particles can come from many sources, including car exhaust, factories and even wildfires. 
            Some of the particles and gases come directly from these sources, but others form through chemical reactions in the air.
            Aerosols can come from other places, too, such as ash from an erupting volcano. Dust, pollen from plants and mold spores are also examples of aerosols.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Is Air Pollution Bad?</h2>
        <img src="pollution3.jpg" style="float:left; border-radius: 20%; margin: 10px; padding-right: 3%;" alt="">
        <p>Air pollution has a range of negative effects on human health. These effects can be minor, such as headaches or eye irritation. However,
            long-term exposure to air pollutants can cause serious health problems such as heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory diseases such as emphysema. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that every year, as many as 7 million people die from the effects of air pollution! 
            Our planet suffers, too. Air pollutants may contaminate our water and soil through direct contact.
            They may also mix with water and oxygen in the atmosphere to form acid rain, which has significant and far reaching 
            effects on our ecosystems. By changing the composition of our soil and degrading the water quality of our rivers and lakes,
            acid rain can affect a wide range of wildlife species dependent on these habitats. 
            Air pollution also contributes to global warming, one of the most pressing problems of our time. Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane trap heat in our atmosphere, contributing to the rise of air and ocean temperatures around the world.</p>
        <h2>How does air pollution affect our health?</h2>
        <p>Breathing in polluted air can be very bad for our health. Long-term exposure to air pollution has been associated with 
            diseases of the heart and lungs, cancers and other health problems. That’s why it’s important for us to monitor air pollution.</p>
        <h2>What else causes air pollution?</h2>
        <img src="ozone-good-bad-illustration.png" style="float:left; border-radius: 25%; margin: 10px; height:250px; padding-bottom: 5%; padding-right: 3%;" alt="">
        <p>Certain gases in the atmosphere can cause air pollution. For example, in cities, a gas called ozone is a major cause of air pollution. Ozone is also a greenhouse gas that can be both good and bad for our environment.
            It all depends where it is in Earth’s atmosphere.Ozone high up in our atmosphere is a good thing. It helps block harmful energy from the Sun, called radiation. But, when ozone is closer to the ground, it can be really bad for our health. Ground level ozone is created when sunlight reacts with certain chemicals that come from sources of burning fossil fuels, such as factories or car exhaust.
            When particles in the air combine with ozone, they create smog. Smog is a type of air 
            pollution that looks like smoky fog and makes it difficult to see.</p>

        <p style="display: block; padding-left: 2%; text-align: center;"><strong>change is the most important issue due to air pollution of our time right now- it will affect every part of our lives,
             from the weather to the animals on the planet. But what is climate change?</strong></p>
        <h2 style="padding-left: 2%;">How does air pollution affect Earth’s climate?</h2>
        <img src="shirt.jpg" style="float:left; border-radius: 35%; margin: 5px; padding-right: 2%;" alt="">
        <p style="padding-left: 2%;">Aerosols can impact how the Sun’s light hits Earth. For example, some aerosols reflect sunlight while others absorb sunlight. It depends on the color of the particle.
            Dark surfaces—whether it’s a black t-shirt or a dark particle in the atmosphere—absorb the Sun's heat. Lighter-colored surfaces reflect heat from the Sun.
            A white t-shirt reflects the Sun on a hot day, making you feel cooler. In the same way, light-colored particles that reflect the Sun’s light and heat away from Earth can make the global temperature cooler. 
            Dark-colored particles that absorb the Sun’s light can make the global temperature warmer.<br>
            Emissions of pollutants into the air can result in changes to the climate. These pollutants, including greenhouse gases, are often referred to as climate forcers. Ozone in the atmosphere warms the climate,
             while different components of PM can have either warming or cooling effects on the climate<br>
             <h3 style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 40px; padding-top: 5%; padding-left: 2%; color: antiquewhite;"><strong>5 dangerous pollutants you’re breathing in every day</strong></h3><br>
             <h5 style="padding-left: 2%; font-size: 20px; color: antiquewhite;">1.PM2.5</h5><br>
             <p style="padding-left: 2%;">PM2.5 refers to fine particles that are 2.5 microns or less in diameter. They are invisible to the naked eye, though noticeable as particle smog in highly polluted areas, and present indoors and out.\
             PM2.5 particles come from combusting unclean fuels for cooking or heating, burning waste and agriculture residue, industrial activities, transportation and windblown dust, among other sources. PM2.5 particles 
             penetrate deep into the lungs and bloodstream, increasing the risk of dying from heart and lung disease, stroke and cancer. These particles can either be emitted directly or formed in the atmosphere from several different emitted pollutants, such as ammonia, and volatile organic compounds.<br>
             </p><h5 style="padding-left: 2%; font-size: 20px; color: antiquewhite;">2.Ground-level ozone</h5><br><p style="padding-left: 2%;">
             Ground-level ozone, or tropospheric ozone, is a short-lived climate pollutant and although it exists only for a few days to a few weeks, it is a strong greenhouse gas. It forms when pollutants from industry,
              traffic, waste and energy production interact in the presence of sunlight. It contributes to smog, worsens bronchitis and emphysema, triggers asthma, damages lung tissue and reduces crop productivity. Exposure to ground-level ozone causes an estimated 472,000 premature deaths every year. Because ozone stunts the growth of plants and forests, it also reduces the amount of carbon that can be sequestered.<br>
             </p><h5 style="padding-left: 2%; font-size: 20px; color: antiquewhite;">3.Nitrogen Dioxide</h5><br><p style="padding-left: 2%;">
             Nitrogen oxides are a group of air polluting chemical compounds, including nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitrogen monoxide. NO2 is the most harmful of these compounds and is generated from the combustion of fuel engines and industry. 
             It can damage the human heart and lungs and it reduces atmospheric visibility at high concentrations. Finally, it is a critical precursor to the formation of ground-level ozone<br>
             </p><h5 style="padding-left: 2%; font-size: 20px; color: antiquewhite;">4.Black Carbon</h5><br><p style="padding-left: 2%;">
             Black carbon, or soot, is a component of PM2.5 and is a short-lived climate pollutant. Agricultural burning to clear land, and the wildfires that sometimes result, are the world’s largest sources of black carbon.
              It also comes from diesel engines, burning trash, and stoves and furnaces that combust fossil and biomass fuels. It causes poor health and premature death and also increases the risk of dementia. Black carbon emissions have been decreasing over the past decades in many developed countries due to stricter air quality regulations. But emissions are high in many developing countries where air quality is poorly regulated. As a result of open biomass burning and residential solid fuel combustion, Asia, Africa and Latin America contribute approximately 88 per cent of global black carbon emissions.<br>
             </p><h5 style="padding-left: 2%; font-size: 20px; color: antiquewhite;">5.Methane</h5><br><p style="padding-left: 2%;">
             Methane comes mainly from agriculture, particularly livestock, sewage and solid waste, and oil and gas production. It helps create ground-level ozone and hence contributes to chronic respiratory illnesses and premature death.
              Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change research shows that methane – a major short-lived climate pollutant – is responsible for at least a quarter of today’s global warming and reducing human-caused methane, which accounts for more than half of all methane emissions, is one of the most effective ways of combatting climate change.

                <div class='water' style="color: beige;">Acid Rain
                    <div style="color: antiquewhite; padding-top: 3%;">Pure water, meaning distilled water or deionised water, has the value of pH7 whereas water from rainfall is between 5 and 5.5, which is slightly acidic.
                        Rainwater will become much more acidic when it is mixed with certain air pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. Typically, rain with a pH value of 4 is
                        considered acid rain, of which the acidity is 10 times that of pH 5. Acid rain is incredibly harmful to natural ecosystems, in particular, its impact on soil. About 45% of the components of soil are minerals including aluminium.If soil becomes acidic, 
                        its aluminium will become soluble and interfere with the root’s cell division as well as its ability to elongate.
                        At the same time, essential nutrients for plants such as calcium will be reduced by exposure to acid rain; this makes it difficult for plants to consume water. Acid rain also threatens wildlife, especially aquatic animals since most
                        function at the optimal pH value between 6.5 to 8.5.</div>
                </div>
                <div class='water'style="color: beige;"> Eutrophication
                    <div style="color:antiquewhite; padding-top: 3%;">Eutrophication is the situation in which a waterbody is enriched with minerals and nutrients that may eventually result in excessive growth of algae. Algae not only blocks out the sunlight from underwater plants,
                        which is necessary for photosynthesis, but it also consumes large amounts of oxygen in the water.  Consequently, aquatic plants and animals may die due to the scarcity of nutrients in the water.Although this phenomenon can occur naturally,
                        it is indisputable that human activities have been accelerating the process. Nitrogen dioxide that is excessively generated during the production of energy is one of the fundamental nutrients that the growth of algae requires. The use of 
                        fertiliser also contributes to eutrophication as nitrogen fertiliser is often applied in agriculture for multiple reasons: Increasing the speed of development of plants, preventing leaves from turning yellow et cetera. Excessive fertiliser 
                        not absorbed by plants that are left on the land will eventually be deposited into the waterbody nearby via rainfall.

                </div>
                <div class='water'style="color: beige;">What can we do <img src="./human-head-with-a-question-mark-inside-svgrepo-com.png" alt="" style="width: 5%; height: 5%;">
                    <div style="color:antiquewhite; padding-top: 3%;">Despite most air pollution being generated from burning fossil fuels, as much as 95% of carbon monoxide comes from motor vehicles in some cities. One of the most efficient methods to reduce the effects of air pollution on the environment is by modifying the way we use motor vehicles.
                        There are many little things that we can easily do as individuals; instead of driving, opt for walking or biking if the travel distance is short, and use public transportation if available. The market also provides consumers with more choices, including electric or hybrid vehicles, to alleviate air pollution.
                        At the national level, things can be more complex since environmental policies are usually detrimental to the countries’ economic development. But there are many policies in which wealthier countries should consider and adopt, including a carbon tax system. 
                        While the original purpose of a carbon tax is to provide an economic incentive to companies and individuals to emit less carbon dioxide by charging consumers at the point of purchase, its function is not limited to fighting against climate change. As air pollution 
                        and greenhouse gases are mostly generated from the same human activities – burning of fossil fuels, emission from vehicles – implementing a carbon tax can hit two birds with one stone.

                <p style="padding-left: 2%;">
                Air pollution is created when harmful substances, in the form of gases, liquids, or solids, enter the air. There are natural processes that create air pollution— such as sulfur and chlorine gases from volcanic activity,
                smoke and ash from wildfires, dust storms, and biological decay — but most pollution enters the air from human-made (anthropogenic) sources.
                Most human-made air pollution comes from burning fossil fuels for transportation, electricity, and industry. Common pollutants produced by engines that burn fossil fuels are carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, volatile 
                organic compounds (VOCs), and particulates. Stoves, incinerators, and open burning produce carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, as well as particulates.
                We also create chemicals that would not naturally occur in the atmosphere. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), which are used as refrigerants, are examples of pollutants that only come from human activity. Other 
                sources of CFCs include fumes from aerosol sprays, paint, varnish, and solvents</p>

                <h5 style="color: aliceblue; padding-left: 2%;">Particulate Matter (PM)<img src="pm_size_comparisons_big.jpg" alt="" style="float: left; border-radius: 10%;  width: 40%; height: 40%; padding-right: 2%; padding-bottom: 2%;"><br></h5>
                <p style="padding-left: 2%;">Particulate matter, also called aerosols or particle pollution, is composed of a large variety of chemicals. Some particles are primary pollutants that come directly from smokestacks, construction sites, fires, or volcanoes. However, most are secondary pollutants that form as the result of chemical reactions in the atmosphere due to emissions from power plants, factories, and vehicles.
                    Particulate matter is classified by size:
                    PM10 is coarse particles with a diameter of 2.5 to 10 micrometers, such as dust, dirt, pollen, and mold.
                    PM2.5 is fine particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less, such as soot, smoke, organic compounds, and metals.

                <h5 style="color: aliceblue; padding-left: 2%;">Nitrogen Dioxide<img src="no2_concentrations_in_2014_with_color_bar.png" alt="" style="float: right; border-radius: 20%; margin: 5px; padding-left: 3%; padding-bottom: 2%; padding-right: 2%;"><br></h5>
                <p style="padding-left: 2%;">Vehicle exhaust is the largest source of nitrogen dioxide pollution in the atmosphere, but it is also formed by factories and power plants, and naturally by lightning strikes, volcanoes, and during the decomposition of organic matter. Nitrogen dioxide causes the characteristic reddish-brown color of smog and reacts in the presence of sunlight to produce harmful ozone.
                </p>
                <h5 style="color: aliceblue; padding-left: 2%;">Ozone (O3)<img src="how_ozone_forms_0.png" alt="" style="float: left; border-radius: 10%;  width: 50%; height: 100%; padding-top: 0%; padding-right: 2%;"></h5>
                <p style="padding-left: 2%;">Though ozone naturally exists within the stratosphere, it does not typically occur at the surface. Ozone in the troposphere is a secondary air pollutant created from chemical reactions with other air pollutants. It forms when nitrogen oxides from tailpipes and smokestacks react with VOCs in the presence of sunlight. Tropospheric ozone, also called ground-level ozone, is most common in urban areas and is often measured at high levels in the summer and during the warmest times of the day.

                    One common type of secondary pollution that contains ozone is smog. Smog is a smelly, toxic haze composed of ground-level ozone, particulate matter, and a variety of other chemicals. Smog is an example of how primary air pollution from human activity can lead to even more harmful secondary pollution.
                </p>
                <h5 style="color: aliceblue; padding-left: 2%;">Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)</h5>
                <p style="padding-left: 2%;">The smell associated with burnt matches comes from sulfur dioxide. Almost all sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere is the result of human activity, though volcanoes are also a natural source. Coal, oil, and gas often contain sulfur, as do some mineral ores. The burning of any of these sulfur-containing materials, during industrial processing or the generation of electricity, releases toxic sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide, together called sulfur oxides, into the atmosphere. When mixed with water droplets suspended in the air, sulfur dioxide forms sulfuric acid, which is a component of acid rain.
                </p>
                <h5 style="color: aliceblue; padding-left: 2%;">Lead (Pb)</h5>
                <p style="padding-left: 2%;">Lead is a heavy metal found naturally underground. It enters the air through ore and metals processing, and through the burning of leaded fuel for aircraft and vehicles. The EPA’s requirement to remove lead from “on-road” vehicle gasoline resulted in a 98% decrease in lead levels in the air between 1980 and 2014 (leaded fuels are still allowed for race cars, farm equipment, and propeller aircraft).
                </p>
                <h5 style="color: aliceblue; padding-left: 2%;">Carbon Monoxide (CO)</h5>
                <p style="padding-left: 2%;">If something is burning, carbon monoxide is likely being released. Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas that is created when carbon is burned. Most of the carbon monoxide pollution comes from burning fossil fuels in vehicles, factories, and power plants, but another major source is from burning wood or crop waste. Carbon monoxide is released from volcanoes and forest fires as well. Secondary pollutants like ozone and carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas, come from carbon monoxide.
                </p>
                <h3 style="color: aliceblue;padding-left: 2%;">Greenhouse Gas Pollution</h3>
                <p style="padding-left: 2%;">The burning of fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and transportation is increasing the amount of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4) in our atmosphere. Small amounts of these gases in the atmosphere are safe to breathe but are also dangerous because they are changing Earth’s climate through a process called the greenhouse effect. Land-use changes due to farming and forestry also lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. For example, livestock and their waste release methane, and cutting down trees means less carbon dioxide is removed from the air. The shift from coal to natural gas as an energy source and the increased use of renewable energy is helping to slow carbon dioxide emissions, but overall, greenhouse gas emissions remain high. As long as greenhouse gas emissions remain high, global average temperatures will continue to rise.
                </p>
                <h3 style="color: aliceblue; padding-left: 2%;">Indoor Pollutants</h3>
                <p style="padding-left: 2%;">Formaldehyde, asbestos, radon gas, and mold are common harmful indoor air pollutants. Many products used in buildings, such as foam insulation, carpet, and furniture glues, give off high levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Paints, varnishes, and cleaning materials also contain VOCs. Smoking indoors adds many pollutants, including cancer-causing chemicals, to the air. If you burn natural gas or wood to heat your home, be sure to monitor for elevated carbon monoxide levels.
                    Because we typically spend many hours indoors, and because indoor pollutants are confined within a small area, the level of exposure needed to cause harm is much lower than for outdoor pollutants. To reduce health risks from indoor pollutants, limit or eliminate the use of products that give off VOCs within your home. Ensure that homes and buildings have adequate ventilation and open doors or windows when using chemicals or introducing materials that contain VOCs to your indoor environment. Visit the EPA’s website to learn more about indoor air quality.

                    <p style="text-align: center;">Air pollution is one of the greatest threats to children’s health. Ninety-nine per cent of people in the world live in places where the air is considered unhealthy. When children breathe toxic air, it harms their health and jeopardizes their future.
                        <br>For children to grow up healthy, they need clean, safe air.</p><br>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">Outdoor and indoor air pollution are directly linked with respiratory infections and other diseases that account for almost 1 in 10 under-five deaths.</p><br>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">Air pollution accounts for 20% of newborn deaths worldwide, most related to complications of low birth weight and preterm birth.</p><br>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">Adults exposed to air pollution as children tend to have respiratory problems later in life</p><br>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2 style="padding-left: 2%;">How does air pollution affect our health?</h2>
                    <figure style="text-align: center;">
                        <img src="health.jpg" alt="" >
                    </figure>
                    <p style="padding-left: 2%;">When the National Ambient Air Quality Standards were established in 1970, air pollution was regarded primarily as a threat to respiratory health. In 1993, NIEHS researchers published the landmark Six Cities Study, which established an association between fine particulate matter and mortality.
                        <br>Air pollution exposure is associated with oxidative stress and inflammation in human cells, which may lay a foundation for chronic diseases and cancer. In 2013, the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization (WHO) classified air pollution as a human carcinogen.
                        <br>Research on air pollution and health effects continually advances. Public health concern now includes cancer, cardiovascular disease, respiratory diseases, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and reproductive, neurological, and immune system disorders
                    </p>
                    <h3 style="color: aliceblue;padding-left: 2%;">Cancer</h3>
                    <p style="padding-left: 2%;">A large study of more than 57,000 women found living near major roadways may increase a woman’s risk for breast cancer.
                        The NIEHS Sister Study found other airborne toxic substances, especially methylene chloride, which is used in aerosol products and paint removers, are also associated with increased risk of breast cancer.
                        Occupational exposure to benzene, an industrial chemical and component of gasoline, can cause leukemia and is associated with non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma.
                        A long-term study, 2000-2016, found an association between lung cancer incidence and increased reliance on coal for energy generation.</p>
                    <h3 style="color: aliceblue; padding-left: 2%;">Cardiovascular Disease</h3>
                    <p style="padding-left: 2%;">Fine particulate matter can impair blood vessel function and speed up calcification in arteries.
                        NIEHS researchers established links between short-term daily exposure by post-menopausal women to nitrogen oxides and increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke.
                        For some older Americans, exposure to TRAP can result in lowered levels of high-density lipoprotein, sometimes called good cholesterol, increasing their risk for cardiovascular disease.
                        According to a National Toxicology Program (NTP) report, TRAP exposure also increases a pregnant woman’s risk for dangerous changes in blood pressure, known as hypertensive disorders, which are a leading cause of pre-term birth, low birth weight, and maternal and fetal illness and death.</p>
                    <h3 style="color: aliceblue; padding-left: 2%;">Respiratory Disease</h3>
                    <p style="padding-left: 2%;">Air pollution can affect lung development and is implicated in the development of emphysema, asthma, and other respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
                        Increases in asthma prevalence and severity are linked to urbanization and outdoor air pollution. Children living in low-income urban areas tend to have more asthma cases than others. Research published in 2023 tied two air pollutants, ozone and PM2.5, to asthma-related changes in children’s airways.
                        PM and nitrogen oxide are linked to chronic bronchitis.
                        In 2020, a major public health challenge was confluence of the COVID-19 pandemic and wildfires across the western U.S. Building on a well-established connection between air pollution and respiratory-tract infections, a study linked wildfire smoke with additional COVID-19 cases and deaths.</p>
                    <h2 style="color: aliceblue; padding-left: 2%;">Whom does air pollution affect the most?</h2>
                    <p style="padding-left: 2%;">Air pollution affects everyone’s health, but certain groups may be harmed more.
                        Almost 9 out of 10 people who live in urban areas worldwide are affected by air pollution</p>
                    <h3 style="color: aliceblue; padding-left: 2%;">Children</h3>
                    <p style="padding-left: 2%;">The NIEHS-funded Children’s Health Study at the University of Southern California is one of the largest studies of the long-term effects of air pollution on children’s respiratory health. Among its findings:

                        Higher air pollution levels increase short-term respiratory infections, which lead to more school absences.
                        Children who play several outdoor sports and live in high ozone communities are more likely to develop asthma.
                        Children living near busy roads are at increased risk for asthma.
                        Children with asthma who were exposed to high levels of air pollutants were more likely to develop bronchitis symptoms.
                        Living in communities with higher pollution levels can cause lung damage.</p>
                    <h3 style="color: aliceblue; padding-left: 2%;">Other studies on women and children</h3>
                    <p style="padding-left: 2%;">NIEHS-funded researchers from the University of California, Davis, Environmental Health Sciences Center are conducting the Bio-Specimen and Fire Effects (B-SAFE) Study. This ongoing project seeks to discover if and how recent wildfires and their smoke affected pregnant women and their babies. Begun in 2017, study participants are pregnant women who were living in Northern California when the 2018, 2019, or 2020 wildfires occurred there.
                        Breathing PM 2.5, even at relatively low levels, may alter the size of a child's developing brain, which may ultimately increase the risk for cognitive and emotional problems later in adolescence.
                        Prenatal exposure to PAHs was associated with brain development effects, slower processing speed, attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, and other neurobehavioral problems in urban youth.
                        In New York City, prenatal exposure to air pollution may play a role in childhood ADHD-related behavior problems.
                        Prenatal exposure to particulate matter was associated with low birth weight.
                        Women exposed to high levels of fine particulate matter during pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester, may have up to twice the risk of having a child with autism.
                        Second and third trimester exposure to PM 2.5 might increase the chance of those children having high blood pressure in early life.
                        In California’s agricultural San Joaquin Valley, women who were exposed to high levels of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, or nitrogen dioxide during their first 8 weeks of pregnancy were more likely to have a baby with neural tube defects.
                        In Marietta, Ohio, home to a ferromanganese refinery, manganese concentrations in blood and hair, a biomarker of air pollution exposure, were associated with lower child IQ scores</p>
                    <h3 style="color: aliceblue; padding-left: 2%;">Older adults</h3>
                    <p style="padding-left: 2%;">Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias are a public health challenge for aging populations. NIEHS-funded researchers at the University of Washington identified a link between air pollution and dementias. This well-conducted study adds considerable evidence that ambient air fine particles increase risk of dementias. Conversely, a multi-year study published in 2022 shows improved air quality is associated with lower risk of dementia in older women. The researchers also stated this decline in dementia risk was equivalent to taking nearly 2 1/2 years off the age of the women studied.
                        Air pollution was linked to a greater chance of developing several neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and other dementias. Hospital admissions data from 63 million older adults in the U.S., obtained over 17 years (2000-2016), was analyzed along with estimated PM 2.5 concentrations by zip code to conduct the study.
                        In older adults, long-term exposure to TRAP may significantly hasten physical disabilities. The risk is more pronounced among racial minorities and lower-income people.
                        Osteoporosis affects women more than men. A large study associated high levels of air pollutants with bone damage, particularly in the lumbar spine, among postmenopausal women. This study expands previous findings linking air pollution and bone damage.
                        Nutrients may counter some harmful effects from air pollution. A 2020 study found omega-3 fatty acids, obtained by eating certain fish, may protect against PM 2.5-associated brain shrinkage in older women</p>
                    <h3 style="color: aliceblue; padding-left: 2%;">Rural dwellers</h3>
                    <p style="padding-left: 2%;">An NIEHS-funded study found that concentrations of PM 2.5 in rural Washington State were comparable to urban Seattle. In this study, as regional PM 2.5 increased, there were increased asthma symptoms, such as limitation of activities, more wheezing, and more nighttime waking, in rural children.
                        NIEHS supported a translational research project,  Addressing Air Pollution and Asthma (1MB), that may lead to improved health for children suffering from asthma. They found that certain agricultural practices contribute to poor air quality and asthma among children. The team combined high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) cleaners and a home-based education program to reduce children’s exposure to pollutants in the home.
                        In the rural U.S., large-scale animal feeding operations might compromise regional air quality through emission of pollutants, such as ammonia gas. A study found acute lung function problems in children with asthma in such areas</p>
                    <h3 style="color: aliceblue; padding-left: 2%;">Different genes</h3>
                    <p style="padding-left: 2%;">Your genes play a role in respiratory health. NIEHS-funded research discovered that people with specific gene variants, which made them more likely to have lung inflammation, had a greater chance of suffering from asthma if they lived close to major roadways</p>
